Modified version of Mergeslacker.

Required tools only include general system tools
such as cp, rm, diff and so on. Also sdiff is 
required for interactive merging. These should
all be in OpenBSD base.

Run this after you have upgraded packages with pkg_add.
The newly installed configuration sample files (@sample markers
in PLIST) will be compared to your current configuration
and interactively merged.
