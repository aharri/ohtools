Very small but robust configuration merging tool
for Slackware Linux and distributions with similar
package management such as Tukaani Linux.
Distros using Pacman (such as Arch Linux) for
package management should work almost out of the box.

Required tools only include general system tools
such as cp, rm, diff and so on. Also sdiff is 
required for interactive merging.

Run this after you have upgraded packages with pkgtool.
The newly installed configuration files (.new suffix)
will be compared and merged with existing files.
