--- Description ---

Attach script with automatic digital camera
extraction and USB printer linker. 

You can make up-to-date symlinks with this
script if you have multiple USB printers.
When plugged in the printer will be assigned
the first available ulptX device node. With
just one printer this isn't a problem, but
with several the names can change so having
a symlink in /dev will fix this issue. Hotplug
will update your symlink and you can configure
your printing spooler to use the symlink.

With automatic digicam extraction you can
just hook your camera into USB port and 
wait for the script to extract images from
it. Supports both PTP and USB Mass Storage
modes!

The files will be removed from the camera
as soon as transfer is complete, and
by default named after EXIF header's date
and shoved into appropriate directories such
as 2007/09/.
