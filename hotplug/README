--- Description ---

Attach script with automatic digital camera
extraction and USB printer linker. 

You can make up-to-date symlink with this
script if you have multiple USB printers
that can pop up as any ulptX is available.

With automatic digicam extraction you can
just hook your camera into USB port and 
wait for the script to extract images from
it. Remember to check your camera is in USB,
and *not* PTP mode! The files will be removed
from the camera as soon as transfer is complete,
named after EXIF header's date and shoved into
appropriate directories such as 2007/09/.

--- Requirements ---

OpenBSD that includes hotplug daemon (All
recent enough releases do).

-- For printer linker --

Nothing external.

-- For digital cameras --

Jhead from graphics/jhead.

--- Installation ---

1. Open the script with your editor and change the
   configuration part.
2. Install as /etc/hotplug/attach:
   # install -o root -g wheel -m 755 attach /etc/hotplug/attach
3. Activate hotplugd: 
   # egrep -q '^hotplugd_flags' /etc/rc.conf.local || echo \
     'hotplugd_flags=""' >> /etc/rc.conf.local
   # hotplugd
4. That's it. Plug in your USB devices. :-)
