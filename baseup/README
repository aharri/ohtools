# Base up

The current way of upgrading OpenBSD is very
simple itself but at least I feel that there's
a need for a little shell script like this:
- easy integrity checking for files
- easier to manage multiple computers running OBSD

I *STRONLY* encourage users to first learn how
the system is upgraded the official way and then
consider using this. It's also worth mentioning
that *NEVER* do this as cron job, it might result
in an unbootable system if there are some runtime
errors. Baseup has pretty good error checking
but there's always a chance for bug, more precise
explanation on that below.

# Requirements

- Only base system of OpenBSD.
- Enough storage space (~250M of temporary space)


# Installing

You can run baseup from anywhere on the disc,
or use the port Makefile from ohtools to make
a system wide installation.

# How it works

## Initialize

1) Ask the user for the source of the tarballs.

## Install, part 1

1) Fetch directory indexes and SHA256
2) Fetch kernel and base
3) Install kernel

It is recommended but *not mandatory* to reboot
at this stage to get the new kernel started before
extracting base system. There are some rare exceptions,
meaning that sometimes you have to install kernel
and extract base at the same time and sometimes you
have to reboot in between. There is no way to be
absolutely sure except reading and understanding
every commit made after your last update. This
is pretty much the only thing that go wrong with
this kind of updating so you should be okay with
this and prepared to fix whatever went wrong.

All that said I always go for kernel+base without
rebooting in between, works 99% of the time.

## Install, part 2

1) Base packages
2) Sysmerge

It is always recommended to sync your configuration
files.
