--- Base up ---

This is a quick draft about the inner workings
of baseup the OpenBSD base system upgrader.

The current way of upgrading OpenBSD is *VERY*
simple itself but at least I feel that there's
a need for a little shell script like this:
- easy integrity checking for files
- easier to manage multiple computers running OBSD

I *STRONLY* encourage users to first learn how
the system is upgraded the official way and then
consider using this. It's also worth mentioning
that *NEVER* do this as cron job, it might result
in an unbootable system if there are some runtime
errors. Baseup has pretty good error checking
but there's always a chance for bug.

--- How ---

-- Initialize --

1) Ask the user for the source of the tarballs.

-- Install, part 1 --

1) Fetch directory indexes and MD5
2) Fetch kernel and base
3) Install kernel

(User reboots and re-runs the script)

-- Install, part 2 --

1) Extra base packages

--- Requirements ---

- Only net/curl from packages and nothing else
  than base system of OpenBSD.
- Enough storage space (~200M of temporary space)
- Sane user.
