--- Base up ---

This is a quick draft about the inner workings
of baseup the OpenBSD base system upgrader.

The current way of upgrading OpenBSD is *VERY*
simple itself but at least I feel that there's
a need for a little shell script like this.

I *STRONLY* encourage users to first learn how 
the system is upgraded the official way and then
consider using this.

--- How ---

1) Ask the user for the source of the tarballs.
2) Fetch appropriate kernel and replace old one.
3) Fetch installed base packages.
4) Set up environment from which baseup can
   continue after kernel reboot.
5) Extract base packages and store a list of
   packages extracted for future execution
   of baseup. Also store the source of the 
   tarballs.

--- Requirements ---

- Nothing else than base system of OpenBSD.
- Enough storage space.
- Sane user.
