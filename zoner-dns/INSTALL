Install:

 - Put the whole directory under Zoner's htdocs dir.

 - Unless you installed zoner.php as nic/update you will need
   to use htaccess.sample (for Apache) to make ddclient to work.
   By default it sends GET request to <http://host/nic/update>.

 - Run 'make' to generate some files.

 - Run php usermod.php to add some users.

 - Configure zoner-config.php.

 - Configure ddclient, see the sample file.

 - Enjoy!
